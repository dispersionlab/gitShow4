### dependencies: 
Requires Max 8. 
Max Package: "MC Movement Studies"

## Run:
Open the max patch "_saltyMoustache~.maxpat"

This is, for now, a wavetable-driven euclidean stepsequencer sequencer. Turn the clock on to run it. 

Each step has one carrier and one modulator wavetable with multiple parameters. Each parameter can be adjusted with its own slider. 

## Score:

If the output from the sequencer sounds rhythmic to you, tweak the parameters that make the rhythm tighter. Then, when you've found a satisfying groove, begin to tweak parameters so that it becomes looser, perhaps more continuous.
